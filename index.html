            <p class = "first">The story of Monkey and Cloud is an exploration adventure through helping. Monkey helps the lost Cloud to find their family and has many wonderful experiences along the journey.</p>

            <p>Throughout the story of Monkey and Cloud there are many things to learn (morals):</p>

            <p><ol>
                <li>To be grateful</li>
                <li>To be helpful to others</li>
                <li>To question things you might be afraid of</li>
                <li>To test things out and see (because maybe they are not actually so scary).</li>
                <li>To see the beauty in diversity.</li>
                <li>To enjoy their adventures.</li>
                <li>To remember their experiences and their friends.</li></ol></p>

            <p>Most of the characters are not a set gender so that anyone can imagine themselves as the main characters. (Only 2 characters have a set gender because they are who the book is dedicated to, the author's grandmother and niece).</p>
